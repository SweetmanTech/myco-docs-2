## What is a Smart Wallet?

For creators, a smart wallet is a powerful authentication tool that acts as your login credentials to manage digital assets and interact with applications. Unlike social media sign-ins, smart wallets offer advanced features such as:

- **Multiple account management**: Create and manage separate accounts for different purposes (e.g., personal, business, specific projects).
- **Enhanced security**: Implement multi-signature functionality and social recovery options.
- **Programmable transactions**: Set up automatic or conditional transactions based on predefined rules.
- **Gas fee optimization**: Automatically adjust gas fees for more cost-effective transactions.
- **Seamless dApp integration**: Easily interact with various decentralized applications, including NFT marketplaces and social platforms.

For creators, smart wallets simplify the process of creating, selling, and managing digital assets while providing a more user-friendly experience in the creator ecosystem.
