# Rewards

`/api/zora/rewards`

## Purpose

The Myco Rewards API provides builders with insights into the Zora rewards protocol. It enables creators and developers to:

1. Track rewards earned from mints on Zora
2. Monitor key metrics such as Daily Active Mints and top collectors
3. Access total rewards earned across the Zora ecosystem

By leveraging this API, developers can build features that give creators visibility into their earnings and engagement on the Zora platform. This aligns with Zora's mission to provide the best tools for creators to monetize their work onchain, as outlined in their [Protocol Rewards documentation](https://docs.zora.co/contracts/rewards).

Some potential use cases include:

- Creating dashboards for creators to visualize their earnings
- Implementing leaderboards for top collectors
- Building analytics tools to track minting activity and reward distribution

The Myco Rewards API serves as a bridge between Zora's protocol rewards system and developer applications, facilitating the creation of value-added services within the Zora ecosystem.
